# Voice-Controlled Home Automation

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates a **Voice-Controlled Home Automation System** built using a **Raspberry Pi 4B**.  
It enables users to control household devices (in this case, LED circuits) using voice commands while also **monitoring voltage and current** in real-time via **ThingSpeak**.  

By integrating **Google Speech-to-Text API** for voice recognition and IoT monitoring through **ThingSpeak**, this system combines **convenience**, **real-time analytics**, and **scalability**.

## üèó System Architecture

### 1. Raspberry Pi 4B
- Acts as the central processing unit.
- Processes voice commands, controls relays, and manages system operations.
- Uses GPIO pins for communication with relay modules, sensors, and ADC.

### 2. 4-Channel Relay Module
- Controls LED circuits on a breadboard.
- Supports multiple devices for scalability.

### 3. Microphone
- Captures voice commands.
- Google Speech-to-Text API processes commands for accurate control.

### 4. LED Circuits
- Connected to relays.
- Provide visual feedback for commands.

### 5. Voltage & Current Sensors
- Monitor electrical parameters in real-time.
- Data sent to ThingSpeak for graphical visualization.

### 6. ADC & I2C Module
- Converts analog sensor readings to digital data for the Raspberry Pi.
- Communicates over I2C protocol.
