# Voice-Controlled Home Automation

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates a **Voice-Controlled Home Automation System** built using a **Raspberry Pi 4B**.
It enables users to control household devices (in this case, LED circuits) using voice commands while also **monitoring voltage and current** in real-time via **ThingSpeak**.

By integrating **Google Speech-to-Text API** for voice recognition and IoT monitoring through **ThingSpeak**, this system combines **convenience**, **real-time analytics**, and **scalability**.

## üèó System Architecture

### 1. Raspberry Pi 4B

* Acts as the central processing unit.
* Processes voice commands, controls relays, and manages system operations.
* Uses GPIO pins for communication with relay modules, sensors, and ADC.

### 2. 4-Channel Relay Module

* Controls LED circuits on a breadboard.
* Supports multiple devices for scalability.

### 3. Microphone

* Captures voice commands.
* Google Speech-to-Text API processes commands for accurate control.

### 4. LED Circuits

* Connected to relays.
* Provide visual feedback for commands.

### 5. Voltage & Current Sensors

* Monitor electrical parameters in real-time.
* Data sent to ThingSpeak for graphical visualization.

### 6. ADC & I2C Module

* Converts analog sensor readings to digital data for the Raspberry Pi.
* Communicates over I2C protocol.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Setup**

1. **Raspberry Pi 4B Wiring**

   * Connect **4-Channel Relay** module to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
   * Wire **LED circuits** (with resistors) to the relay‚Äôs output terminals.
   * Connect **Voltage & Current sensors** to the ADC module.
   * Connect ADC to Raspberry Pi via I2C (SDA, SCL, VCC, GND).
   * Plug in a **USB microphone** to the Pi.

2. **Power Supply**

   * Power Raspberry Pi via its USB-C power adapter.
   * Ensure relay and sensors have a suitable power source (e.g., 5V from Pi).

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Google Speech-to-Text API Setup**

1. Create a **Google Cloud Project** at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable the **Speech-to-Text API**.
3. Create a **Service Account Key** (JSON file) and download it.
4. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ ThingSpeak Configuration**

1. Create a **ThingSpeak account** at [ThingSpeak.com](https://thingspeak.com/).
2. Create a new **channel** and note your **Write API Key**.
3. Update the API key in `SmartHomeAutomation.py`.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Project**

```bash
python3 SmartHomeAutomation.py
```

* Speak a command like `"Turn on LED 1"` or `"Turn off LED 2"`.
* Voltage and current readings will be uploaded to ThingSpeak in real-time.
